from math import gcd

'''
just notice that values in the list are between 1 and 1000
so a lot of these appears multiple times, we just care of last occurence, since
it maximizes the index.

We create a (small) dictionnary d, s.t. d[x] = last occurence of x
then we search among all x,y in the keys of d verifying x^y=1, the maximum of
d[x] + d[y]

there are at most 10‚Å∂ couples, so that's fast enough'''
